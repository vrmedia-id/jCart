# jCart - Free Ajax/PHP Shopping Cart

Because this cool project is no longer being continued by its original creator, I have the idea to fix and update some of the code so that it can still be used by many people. Here are some of the functions I've fixed and added:

## Improve

- Fixed the previously error delete cart button
- Fix checkout function with paypal
- And many more

## Increase
- Supports php 7.2 or greater
- Added bootstrap version 5.2
- Added dropdown cart
- And many more
## Original Features

- PayPal checkout integration
- Simple integration with your site
- XHTML compliance
- Full functionality with javascript disabled
- Server side input validation
- Easy customization with your text and CSS
- Fully commented code
